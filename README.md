##### Application Name: PUMP IT!
##### Tag Line: "Gas, simplified!"
##### Description: We see this application as a way to streamline the user’s experience at gas station, allowing them to spend less time waiting for payments to process and more time back on the road. This will occur by allowing users to store their preferences within the application, including type of gas, payment information, car was preferences depending on station, and group membership numbers for companies that utilize membership or rewards systems. Each user will be assigned a random identification number that they will have to enter whenever they wish to conduct a transaction. This number will be shown on the user’s mobile device, and will not be stored on the device or servers in anyway. This will allow for a quick transaction, and a more streamlined approach. This also will help the companies that sign up to support this service, as the companies will be able to serve more customers because of the efficiency introduced. This will be especially helpful for companies that utilize membership or rewards system, as our application will communicate that information to the company within the transaction authorization. We see this as an opportunity to enhance the experience of buying gas for consumers.
